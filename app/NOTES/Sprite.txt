for e.g Falling sprite

first sprite / animation execute:
  fall sprite

then when fall sprite finish
if "finish" state is TRUE (meaning go continue to the next looping sprite), execute:
  fall idle sprite (which loops endlessly until explicitly stopped)

** then **

if current sprite is stopped,

"finish" state will be TRUE for next sprite sequence. 

Then repeat cycle
