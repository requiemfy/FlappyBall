try to use Symbol() key to skip non physical entity props in for

edited matter js Body.js to add gravity scaling
https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/503

IN PORTRAINT: 
floor length is only the screen width, therefore
if you want to extend WALL_DISTANCE, since there's is falling wall which means that
wall is dynamic (affected by gravity), you have to extend the FLOOR, to catch it.

SWAP:
there are only 2 cases we use SWAP
1) in orientation, we pass player, and wall properties
2) in game restart, we don't pass any body properties, everything in creation should be fresh default

START:
1) play - automatic START
2) resume or restart - manual start

paused, over, willUnmount:
  pause - for pausing and resuming
  over - disable resume
       - to show menu game over
       - make 'willUnmount' true
  willUnmount - component should be unmounted
       - no more events or side effects should work



       
NOTE:
i commented 'game.paused' in collision event
